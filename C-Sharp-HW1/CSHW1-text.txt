2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?
Value Type variables contain the data directly, while reference type variables store reference to their data
Each value type variable has its own copy of data, but two reference type variables can reference the same object
Operations on one value type variable don't affect another value type variable, but operations on a reference type variable may affect other reference type variables 

Boxing is converting value type variables to Object, which allows values store in the heap.
Unboxing is the reversal operation of boxing. It converts Object back to value type variable.

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
managed resource is the resource that is managed by garbage collector of .NET(free automatically)
unmanaged resource is the resource that require users to free memory allocation manually after using. 

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
The purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET is to help users manage memory efficiently. With Garbage Collector users don't need to manually release memory for managed resources. 
GC will also allocates objects on managed heap efficiently.
